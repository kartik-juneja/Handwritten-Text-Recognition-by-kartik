python main.py --train 
v.	To validate the model 
      python main.py â€“validate
4.	The process of training and validating model is very time consuming you can skip this 3rd step by using pre trained model which I have uploaded as zip in gdrive just extract the zip file in model folder.
The link of model is https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qRE3w_NrfKljyIOmoEruU9lr5m-VNzZC/view?usp=sharing

5.	Now you are ready to get the prediction from the model.
vi.	To open the model in browser and get prediction on your data
python upload.py
vii.	This will give you a IP address just open this IP in your browser upload the image and get the text extract from it.
